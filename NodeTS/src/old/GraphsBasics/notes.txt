Undirected Graph:

E(u,v) === E(v,u)


Common problems and Graph Theory Solutions:

1. Shortest path:
  BFS (unweighted graph), Dijkstra, Bellman Ford, Floyd Warshall, A* .. etc
2. Connectivity:
  DFS, Union-Find
3. Detecting Negative Cycles: (good to have in arbitrage trading, bad elsewhere generally)
  Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall
4. Strongly COnnected Component
  Tarjan, Kosaraju
5. Travelling Salesman:
  Held Karp, Branch and Bound, Approximation Algo like Ant-Colony
6. Bridges and Artiulation points
7. Minimal SPanning Tree
8. Network Flow : Max Flow 
  Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp and Dinic


DFS Overview:
By itself, not much. simple algo, has O(V+E) time. 
But shines when used to find Connected Component, determine connectivity, bridges/articulation points etc
